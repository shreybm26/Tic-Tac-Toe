# Tic-Tac-Toe

Hi guys

The code which I have written is the one for the simple game of Tic Tac Toe that you might have played.
I have created using Python GUIs with the help of tkitner module.
Any person having basic knowledge of creating GUIs in Python 3.x will surely understand the code.
If you get stuck somewhere in the code, feel free to ask.

I tried creating a reset option in the game but failed to do so. If anyone can help me out with that too, I'll be grateful!

!!ENJOY!!
